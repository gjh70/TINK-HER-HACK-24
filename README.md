Description:
The Household Worker Connect App is a simple graphical user interface (GUI) application built using Tkinter in Python. It allows users to search for household workers based on their skills.

Features:

Users can enter the skill they are looking for in a designated entry field.
The app searches through a database of workers and displays the matched workers in a listbox.
If no workers are found with the specified skill, a message box notifies the user.
Users can exit the application by clicking the exit button.
Installation:

Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
Clone or download the repository containing the code.
Run the household_worker_connect.py file using Python.
